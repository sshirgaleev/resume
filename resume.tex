    \resumeSubheading
      {Software Engineer, II}{ August, 2022 -- Present}
      {Company Name}{San Francisco, NY}
      \resumeItemListStart
      \resumeItem{ Reduced duplication by stepping up to build an internal Java service for data serialization, then it. The service was adopted by an internal monitoring tool used by across multiple organizations.}
      \resumeItem{ Led multiple sprint plannings on a team of 7 engineers.}
      \resumeItem{Currently learning Scala on the side. After teaching myself Groovy, I became interested in learning another language built on top of the JVM. By going deep with two very different languages—a more dynamic and a more static—I expect to be able to make more pragmatic decisions when choosing languages for projects that interoperate with Java .}
      \resumeItem{ Defined, designed, implemented and rolled out a multi-tier customer profile service, using Java, leading a team of four engineers. This service is used by five other teams.}
      \resumeItem{ Introduced best practices on reliability, monitoring and alerting. Built a Grafana generator that creates dashboards from microservice code: this tool was adopted by more than 10 teams. Improved testing practices by developing a reverse proxy for testing, caching calls to the test environment, adopted by my team.}
      \resumeItem{ Improved how we do rollouts by introducing a beta environment, where new features can be rolled out for a selected amount of customers. Rolled out this environment company-wide.}
